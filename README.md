My own linux shell

I used a while loop to loop continously until exited using the command exit or ctrl-c;
The loop contains a read  the stdin function, parse the input function and a execute command function
The builtin functions I included in my shell are cd and exit. Apart from these all functions accessible by files in /bin can be executed in the shell.
the prompt for the shell is "newShell > "
